Okay, thank you for creating the `ERRORS.md` file and providing the link. This is very helpful!

I have accessed and reviewed the information you provided in `https://github.com/yaboypat1/adb-insight/blob/main/ERRORS.md`.

Based on the `ERRORS.md` file, here's an analysis of the issues and potential solutions:

**Issue 1: ADB Not Found / `FileNotFoundError` on Startup**

* **Error:** `FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified` during `subprocess.run(['adb', '--version'], ...)`
* **File:** `utils/adb_utils.py` (likely in `check_adb_connection` or a similar initial check).
* **Cause:** The Python script cannot find the `adb.exe` executable. This usually happens because the directory containing `adb.exe` (typically the Android SDK `platform-tools` directory) is not included in your system's `PATH` environment variable. The application relies on being able to call `adb` directly from the command line.
* **Log Confirmation:** The log entry `ERROR:root:ADB command failed: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified` confirms this.
* **Solution / Suggestions:**
    1.  **Verify ADB Installation:** Ensure you have Android SDK Platform Tools installed.
    2.  **Add ADB to PATH:** Find the directory containing `adb.exe` (e.g., `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools`). Add this full directory path to your Windows `PATH` environment variable. You might need to restart your command prompt, IDE, or even your computer for the change to take effect.
    3.  **Specify Full Path (Code Change - Alternative):** Less ideally, you could modify the `adb_utils.py` code to accept or detect the full path to `adb.exe` instead of relying solely on the `PATH`. This could be done via a configuration file or a settings dialog in the app. For example, change `subprocess.run(['adb', ...])` to `subprocess.run([path_to_adb, ...])`.
    4.  **Error Handling:** Improve the error message in the application. Instead of just logging the `FileNotFoundError`, catch it specifically and display a user-friendly message like "ADB executable not found. Please ensure Android SDK Platform Tools are installed and the path is configured correctly in your system's PATH environment variable."

**Issue 2: Device List Empty / Not Updating**

* **Error:** No specific error message mentioned, but the device list in the UI remains empty even when devices are connected and visible via `adb devices` in a separate terminal.
* **File:** Likely involves `tabs/device_tab.py` (responsible for displaying devices) and `utils/adb_utils.py` (specifically the function that runs `adb devices` and parses the output, e.g., `get_connected_devices`).
* **Log Confirmation:** The log shows `INFO:root:ADB devices command executed successfully.` followed by `INFO:root:Devices found: []`, even when devices *should* be present.
* **Potential Causes & Solutions:**
    1.  **Parsing Logic:** The most likely culprit is the parsing logic in `adb_utils.py`'s `get_connected_devices` (or similar function).
        * Check how the output of `adb devices` is being split into lines and processed.
        * `adb devices` often includes header lines ("List of devices attached") and potentially blank lines. Ensure these are skipped correctly.
        * Devices might be in states other than "device" (e.g., "unauthorized", "offline"). Is the parsing logic handling these cases or only looking for lines ending in `\tdevice`? Print the raw output received by the function to compare it with what you expect.
    2.  **Threading/UI Update:** If the ADB command is run in a separate thread (which is good practice to avoid freezing the UI), ensure the UI update (populating the list widget) is correctly signaled and executed back on the main UI thread. PyQt/PySide requires UI updates to happen in the main thread (e.g., using signals and slots). Check how the result from `get_connected_devices` is passed back to `DeviceTab`.
    3.  **Initial Call:** Is the function to refresh devices actually being called when the tab is shown or when a refresh button is clicked? Verify the signal/slot connections for the refresh action.

**Issue 3: App List Empty / Error Fetching Apps**

* **Error:** App list remains empty, and logs show `ERROR:root:Failed to fetch packages: Command 'adb shell pm list packages -f --user 0' returned non-zero exit status 1.` followed potentially by stderr output like `cmd: Failure calling service package: Broken pipe` or similar.
* **File:** `tabs/app_tab.py` (displays apps) and `utils/adb_utils.py` (runs `adb shell pm list packages ...` commands).
* **Log Confirmation:** The `non-zero exit status 1` and potentially `Broken pipe` clearly indicate the `adb shell` command failed on the device side.
* **Potential Causes & Solutions:**
    1.  **Device State/Connection:** A `Broken pipe` error often suggests an unstable ADB connection or an issue on the Android device itself.
        * Try unplugging and replugging the device.
        * Run `adb kill-server` followed by `adb start-server` in your terminal.
        * Revoke and re-authorize USB debugging permissions on the device.
        * Try the same `adb shell pm list packages -f --user 0` command manually in your terminal. Does it work there consistently? If it also fails there sometimes, the issue is likely with the device/ADB connection stability rather than the Python code itself.
    2.  **Command Variations:** You are fetching user apps (`--user 0`), system apps, disabled apps, etc., using different `pm list packages` flags. Test each specific command variant manually in the terminal to see which one(s) fail.
    3.  **Error Handling:** The Python code should catch the `subprocess.CalledProcessError`, log the `stderr` output (which you are doing - good!), and potentially inform the user that fetching the app list failed, suggesting they check the device connection.
    4.  **Parsing:** Similar to the device list, double-check the parsing logic for the package list output in `app_tab.py` or `adb_utils.py`, although the primary error here seems to be the command execution itself.

**Issue 4: `dumpsys meminfo` Parsing / Display**

* **Error:** Memory information is not displayed correctly or causes an error (details vague in `ERRORS.md`, needs clarification). Let's assume potential issues.
* **File:** `tabs/app_tab.py` (likely initiates the request and displays results) and `utils/memory_analyzer.py` or similar (parses `dumpsys meminfo` output).
* **Potential Causes & Solutions:**
    1.  **Command Execution:** Ensure `adb shell dumpsys meminfo <package_name>` is executed correctly. Does it fail with a non-zero exit code sometimes?
    2.  **Parsing Logic:** `dumpsys meminfo` output can be complex and vary slightly between Android versions. The parsing code needs to be robust.
        * Use regular expressions carefully to extract specific values (PSS Total, Java Heap, Native Heap, etc.).
        * Handle cases where certain sections might be missing.
        * Print the raw `dumpsys meminfo` output obtained by the script and compare it against your parsing logic. Use a tool like RegExr or regex101.com to test your patterns against the actual output.
    3.  **Data Conversion:** Ensure values extracted (e.g., "12,345 kB") are correctly converted to numbers (e.g., removing commas, handling "kB") before any calculations or display formatting.
    4.  **UI Update:** Again, ensure results from parsing are correctly passed back to the UI thread for display.

**General Recommendations:**

* **Robust Error Handling:** Add more specific `try...except` blocks around subprocess calls (catching `FileNotFoundError`, `subprocess.CalledProcessError`, `subprocess.TimeoutExpired`) and parsing logic (catching `ValueError`, `IndexError`, etc.). Provide informative messages to the user and logs.
* **Threading:** Ensure all blocking ADB calls are run in separate worker threads (e.g., using `QThread`) to prevent the GUI from freezing. Use signals and slots to communicate results back to the main thread safely. Your `Worker` class seems to aim for this, ensure it's used correctly for all ADB operations.
* **Logging:** Add more detailed logging, especially printing the raw output received from ADB commands *before* parsing, which is invaluable for debugging parsing issues. Log which specific command is being run.
* **Clearer UI Feedback:** When an operation fails (like fetching devices or apps), update the UI status bar or show a message box to inform the user, rather than just failing silently or only logging.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Focus on Issue 1 (ADB Path):** Fix the `FileNotFoundError` first, as it's fundamental. Ensure ADB runs correctly from your script's environment.
2.  **Debug Issue 2 (Device List):** Add print statements or use a debugger to inspect the raw output of `adb devices` as received by your script and step through the parsing function in `adb_utils.py`.
3.  **Investigate Issue 3 (App List):** Run the failing `adb shell pm list packages ...` commands manually in a terminal to isolate whether it's a connection issue or a script issue. If it works manually, debug the `subprocess` call and error handling in Python.

Let me know if you'd like me to focus on a specific error or file first, or if you can provide tracebacks for any crashes related to the App Tab or Memory Info parsing.
